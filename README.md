# dogs-chasing-humans

A reddit bot

It listens for the comment "I don't like dogs." and replies to it on the subreddit r/Dogfree.

To start,

do a `npm install` or `yarn` to install the packages
and then copy the `env.sample` file to `.env`

You need to create a new application on reddit, and setup your keys etc

see https://blog.syntonic.io/2017/07/07/reddit-bot-nodejs-example/

to start the project,

we do `yarn start` or `npm run start`
